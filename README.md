# Persona Profile Repository

Welcome to my Persona Profile repository! This website serves as a showcase of the projects I've completed during the Communication Lab class. It also includes a personal description and is designed with a theme inspired by the forest throughout different seasons—spring, summer, and autumn.

## Theme: Exploring the Forest

### Concept

The forest theme not only provides a visually appealing backdrop but also symbolizes the passage of time and the various stages of life. Living in a region where the four seasons might not be as distinct, the forest becomes a metaphor for growth and a connection to nature.

### Technical Implementation

In the development of this website, I implemented the parallax effect and randomized animations to enhance the user experience. Credit is given to the following resources that provided valuable insights and tutorials:

## Website Content

The website tells my story through the lens of the projects completed in the Communication Lab class. It includes detailed descriptions of each project and a personal self-description. As the journey continues, I may add more content, providing insights into my experiences and additional links.
